Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 INTICOIN is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. INTICOIN uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. INTICOIN Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 This package provides INTICOIN-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a INTICOIN daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
